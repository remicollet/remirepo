; Enable Zend OPcache extension module
zend_extension=@EXTPATH@/opcache.so

;	Opcache On/Off switch. When set to Off, code is not optimized.
;opcache.enable=1
;opcache.enable_cli=0

;	The OPcache shared memory storage size. The amount of memory for storing
;	precompiled PHP code in Mbytes.
opcache.memory_consumption=128

;	The amount of memory for interned strings in Mbytes.
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8

;	The maximum number of keys (scripts) in the OPcache hash table.
;	The number is actually the the first one in the following set of prime
;	numbers that is bigger than the one supplied: { 223, 463, 983, 1979, 3907,
;	7963, 16229, 32531, 65407, 130987 }. Only numbers between 200 and 100000
;	are allowed.
opcache.max_accelerated_files=4000

;	The maximum percentage of "wasted" memory until a restart is scheduled.
;opcache.max_wasted_percentage=5

;	When this directive is enabled, the OPcache appends the current working
;	directory to the script key, thus eliminating possible collisions between
;	files with the same name (basename). Disabling the directive improves
;	performance, but may break existing applications.
;opcache.use_cwd=1

;	When disabled, you must reset the OPcache manually or restart the
;	webserver for changes to the filesystem to take effect.
;	The frequency of the check is controlled by the directive
;	"opcache.revalidate_freq".
;opcache.validate_timestamps=1

;	How often (in seconds) to check file timestamps for changes to the shared
;	memory storage allocation. ("1" means validate once per second, but only
;	once per request. "0" means always validate)
;opcache.revalidate_freq=2

;	Enables or disables file search in include_path optimization
;	If the file search is disabled and a cached file is found that uses
;	the same include_path, the file is not searched again. Thus, if a file
;	with the same name appears somewhere else in include_path, it
;	won't be found. Enable this directive if this optimization has an effect on
;	your applications. The default for this directive is disabled, which means
;	that optimization is active.
;opcache.revalidate_path=0

;	If disabled, all PHPDoc comments are dropped from the code to reduce the
;	size of the optimized code.
;opcache.save_comments=1

;	If disabled, PHPDoc comments are not loaded from SHM, so "Doc Comments"
;	may be always stored (save_comments=1), but not loaded by applications
;	that don't need them anyway.
;opcache.load_comments=1


;	If enabled, a fast shutdown sequence is used for the accelerated code
;	The fast shutdown sequence doesn't free each allocated block, but lets
;	the Zend Engine Memory Manager do the work.
opcache.fast_shutdown=1

;	Allow file existence override (file_exists, etc.) performance feature.
;opcache.enable_file_override=0

;	A bitmask, where each bit enables or disables the appropriate OPcache
;	passes
;opcache.optimization_level="0xffffffff"

;	Enable this hack as a workaround for "can't redeclare class" errors.
;	The OPcache stores the places where DECLARE_CLASS opcodes use
;	inheritance (These are the only opcodes that can be executed by PHP,
;	but which may not be executed because the parent class is missing due to
;	optimization). When the file is loaded, OPcache tries to bind the
;	inherited classes by using the current environment. The problem with this
;	scenario is that, while the DECLARE_CLASS opcode may not be needed for the
;	current script, if the script requires that the opcode at least be defined,
;	it may not run. The default for this directive is disabled, which means
;	that optimization is active. In php-5.3 and above this hack is not needed
;	anymore and this setting has no effect.
;opcache.inherited_hack=1

;	Enable this hack as a workaround for "Cannot redeclare class" errors.
;opcache.dups_fix=0

;	The location of the OPcache blacklist file.
;	The OPcache blacklist file is a text file that holds the names of files
;	that should not be accelerated. The file format is to add each filename
;	to a new line. The filename may be a full path or just a file prefix
;	(i.e., /var/www/x  blacklists all the files and directories in /var/www
;	that start with 'x'). Files are usually triggered by one of the following
;	three reasons:
;	1) Directories that contain auto generated code, like Smarty or ZFW cache.
;	2) Code that does not work well when accelerated, due to some delayed
;	   compile time evaluation.
;	3) Code that triggers an OPcache bug.
;opcache.blacklist_filename

;	Allows exclusion of large files from being cached.
;	By default all files are cached.
;opcache.max_file_size=0

;	Check the cache checksum each N requests.
;	The default value of "0" means that the checks are disabled.
;	Because calculating the checksum impairs performance, this directive should
;	be enabled only as part of a debugging process.
;opcache.consistency_checks=0

;	How long to wait (in seconds) for a scheduled restart to begin if the cache
;	is not being accessed.
;	The OPcache uses this directive to identify a situation where there may
;	be a problem with a process. After this time period has passed, the
;	OPcache assumes that something has happened and starts killing the
;	processes that still hold the locks that are preventing a restart.
;	If the log level is 3 or above, a "killed locker" error is recorded
;	in the Apache logs when this happens.
;opcache.force_restart_timeout=180

;	OPcache error_log file name. Empty string assumes "stderr".
;opcache.error_log=stderr

;	All OPcache errors go to the Web server log.
;	By default, only fatal errors (level 0) or errors (level 1) are logged.
;	You can also enable warnings (level 2), info messages (level 3) or
;	debug messages (level 4).
;opcache.log_verbosity_level=1

;	Preferred Shared Memory back-end. Leave empty and let the system decide.
;opcache.preferred_memory_model=

;	Protect the shared memory from unexpected writing during script execution.
;	Useful for internal debugging only.
;opcache.protect_memory=0
