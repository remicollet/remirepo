Disable the outfile_loaddata test, which as of 5.1.38 is giving
platform-dependent results, with the "expected" results being arguably the
wrong ones.  This is upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46895
(note that upstream has also disabled it, but only for Solaris, so we still
need this patch).
