# You need to set this to On, for the mod to work.. By default, the mod is
# disabled, and wont limit anything.
# 
# Example :
#           BandWidthModule On
# 
# BandWidthModule [On|Off]

BandWidthModule On

# When enabled (disabled by default) the log will output lots of data to the
# error log. This data is for debugging purposes, and is usually not needed.
# If you are curious, you can enable. Please note, that this will make your
# logs grow a LOT.
#    
# Example :
#           BandWidthDebug On
# 
# BandWidthDebug [On|Off]
 
# By default, the mod will catch every request. This was done because it is
# easier to configure.
# if you disable it, you will have to add the output filter by hand. This is
# useful is you want only some request being processed by bw_mod.
#    
# Example :
#           ForceBandWidthModule Off
#           AddOutputFilterByType BW_MOD text/html text/plain
# 
# ForceBandWidthModule [On|Off]

# This takes 2 parameters. From is the origin of the connections. It could
# be a full host, part of a domain, an ip address, a network mask (i.e
# 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) or all.
# The second parameter indicates the total speed available to the Origin.
# If speed is 0, there is no limit.
# 
# Example :
#         BandWidth localhost 10240
#         BandWidth 192.168.218.5 0
# 
#         ( Order is relevant. First entries have precedence )
# 
# BandWidth [From] [bytes/s]

# This takes 2 parameters. From is the origin of the connections. It could
# be a full host, part of a domain, an ip address, a network mask (i.e
# 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) or all.
# The second parameter indicates the minimun speed each client will have.
# What does this mean ? If you have a total of 100kbytes speed, and you put
# MinBandWidth at 50kbytes, it doesnt matter how many clients you have, all
# of them will have at minimun 50kbytes of total speed to download.
# If speed is 0, you will be using the default minimun (256 bytes/s).
# There is a special value of -1. This value means that each client, will
# have a top speed determined by the BandWidth directive. See the examples.
# 
# Examples :
#           BandWidth    all 102400
#           MinBandWidth all 50000
#  
#          The example above, will have a top speed of 100kb for the 1°
#         client. If more clients come, it will be splitted accordingly but
#         everyone will have at least 50kb (even if you have 50 clients)
# 
#           BandWidth    all 50000
#           MinBandWidth all -1
# 
#          This example, makes everyone have 50kb as top speed.
# 
# MinBandWidth [From] [bytes/s]

# Type, is the last part of a file, or * for all. You can use .tgz to match 
# only tar-compressed files, .avi to match video files, or * to match all.
# Minimum Size, is the size (in kbytes) of the file, to be matched. That way
# you can match huge video files that hog your bandwidth.
# The last parameter... is obvious. The speed allowed.
# 
# Example :
#          LargeFileLimit .avi 500 10240
# 
#          This limits .avi files over (or equal to) 500kb to 10kbytes/s
# 
# LargeFileLimit [Type] [Minimum Size] [bytes/s]

# Probably you never need to touch this. It defaults to 8192 which is good
# for almost any speed.
# It must be a size between 1024 and 131072. A Small packet will cause the
# top speed to be lower, and the mod using more time splitting. If you use
# a Size too big, the mod will adjust it to lower speeds.
# 
# BandWidthPacket [Size]

# This directives is useful to deliver a personalized error code.
# At default, when maxconnections is reached, the mod will issue a 503 
# HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE code. For some users, it is annoying to have an
# error message, and dont knowing why. You could use an ErrorDocument to 
# point error 503 to a page explaining that you are under a heavy load of
# connections, but sometimes 503 isn't issued by the mod.
# So, with this directive, you can set the error code to return when
# maxconnections is reached. You can use any error code between 300 and 599.
# Please note, that some of the error codes are already used, so before using
# any number, take a look to a list of the codes (search for http error codes
# in google). 
# When testing, i've used the error code 510, which hasn't been defined yet.
# 
# And Example, with Personalized Error Page :
# 
#   ErrorDocument 510 /errors/maxconexceeded.html
#   BandWidthError 510
# 
# Note : Sometimes, the personalized page didn't appear. I'm not sure, but
#       in many cases, it got fixed, by making the page size over 1024bytes.
#        Anyways, if you need help using ErrorDocument, refer to the apache
#       Documentation.
# 
# BandWidthError [Error]

# This takes 2 parameters. From is the origin of the connections. It could
# be a full host, part of a domain, an ip address, a network mask (i.e
# 192.168.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) or all.
# The second parameter, is the max connections allowed from the origin. Any
# connection over Max, will get a 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable
# 
# There is a catch. You NEED to have a BandWidth limit for the same origin.
# It doesnt need to be a low limit. You can use an unlimited setting.
# You might wonder why. It's because im using them same memory space of the
# bandwidth limit, to count the connections, so i can save memory space.
# If you dont put a BandWidth using the same origin, MaxConnections will be
# ignored.
# 
# Example :
#           BandWidth all 0
#           MaxConnection all 20
# or
#           BandWidth all 0
#           BandWidth 192.168.0.0/24 10240
#           MaxConnection all 20
#           MaxConnection 192.168.0.0/24 5
# 
# 
# Please, rememeber that every speed, will depend mostly on your connection.
# You cant get more speed if you dont have it.
# 
# Remember also.. if you dont follow the instructions, and get some weird 
# results, recheck your config before sending me an email.
