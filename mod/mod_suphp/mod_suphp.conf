# This option tells mod_suphp which path to pass on to the PHP-interpreter
# (by setting the PHPRC environment variable).
# Do *NOT* refer to a file but to the directory the file resists in.
#
# E.g.: If you want to use "/path/to/server/config/php.ini", use "suPHP_Config
# /path/to/server/config".
#
# If you don't use this option, PHP will use its compiled in default path.
