Disable the outfile_loaddata test, which as of 5.1.38 is giving
platform-dependent results, with the "expected" results being arguably the
wrong ones.  This is upstream at http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=46895
(note that upstream has also disabled it, but only for Solaris, so we still
need this patch).

Also disable sys_vars.plugin_dir_basic, which is broken because
mysql-test-run doesn't set the right value of MYSQL_LIBDIR.  Upstream at
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=52223

Also disable perfschema.binlog_mix and perfschema.binlog_row, which have
expected output that doesn't match when openssl is in use.  Upstream at
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59091

Also disable gis, which expects the results of floating-point calculations
to match to seventeen digits precision everywhere.  Of course they won't.
